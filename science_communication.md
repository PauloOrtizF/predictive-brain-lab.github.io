# Communicating Your Research Findings
The ability to clearly communicate your findings with other researchers and the general public is one of the most important skills to have as a scientist. For instance, think about the emphasis we give to paper figures during journal club discussions. They not only emphasize key points in a paper but also enable other researchers to consider alternative conclusions from the same data.

The present section will provide  guidelines or resources you can use to generate figures, posters, give lectures or other forms of scientific communication.

- [Scientific Poster](#scientific-poster)

## Creating Figures
Eye-catching figures and fonts do not onlu facilitate communication but imrpove the experience of listening to a presentation or reading a paper! Mastering the skill of creating visually appealing figures directly from your code editor (Python, MatLab, R) not only saves you time but also promotes reproducibility in your analyses!

### Generating Figures
Various resources are available for learning how to create figures from your data. Below, we'll highlight those tailored to the three main programs used by lab members: **Python, R, and Matlab**. (note: _if you are new to programming, check the [Technical Help](./technical_help.md) section, we highlight resources to learn how to code_)

Nonetheless, there are notions that are important to keep in mind regardless of the software used for your analyses. [Here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833) is a concise paper with ten important considerations to keep in mind when generating figures.

**MatLab Resources**

This website contains useful information on how to visualize and generate figures using MATLAB:
* [MATLAB for Data Processing and Visualization](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-for-data-processing-and-visualization/mlvi)

As a member of the Donders Insitute, you can download MATLAB on your office PC free of charge. Simply reach out to the Technical Group (TG) or refer to the institute's intranet [page](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=computerservices) for assistance. If you prefer to install it on your personal computer, you can obtain an educational license using your university email. The TG can assist you with this process as well.

**Python Resources**

You can find a large range of tutorials for data visualization using Python online. Here, we will mention resources that have been useful for members of the lab.

The two main visualization libraries in Python are the following:
* [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) - Widely used, and includes a large range of visualization options. Their website provides tutorials as well as sample code.
* [SeaBorn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) - Visualization library based on matplotlib. Elegant and user friendly. Increasingly popular in the Neuro-AI community. Includes sample code and tutorials for different kinds of plots.

**R Resources**

You can find a wide range of tutorials for data visualization using R. We will mention the most common libraries and direct you to websites that provide tutorials to master their usage.

* [GGPlot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) - Library commonly used in the field of statistics to generate diverse plots. User friendly and flexible to generate a wide variety of plots. Their website provides extensive explanations and code examples.


If you do not feel confident to use these skills on your own or simply by looking at the sample code. These tutorials are great to introduce you to these Python and R libraries:

* [DataCamp Visualization Tutorials for Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses?technologies=2&topics=4) -
* [DataCamp Visualization Tutorials for R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/data-visualization-with-r) 
* [CodeAcademy for Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/visualize-data-with-python) 

Important to note is that these two resources are mostly paid (CodeAcademy has some free options). Ask lab members how to get free access. 

### Editing Figures for Manuscripts

Small tweaks might be needed in your code generated figures before they are publication ready. Where do you generate images visualizing your experimental procedure? Here is software that will do the job well for you:

* [**Adobe Illustrator**](https://www.adobe.com/nl/products/illustrator.html) (paid software)
_How to get it?_ You can have it installed on your office PC (just ask the TG). If you wish to have it on your own computer, check surfspot (https://www.surfspot.nl/). Sign up with your RU account on surfspot, and youâ€™ll be able to get Adobe Creative Cloud service by paying only ~20 euros per year.
_How to start from scratch?_ There are numerous YouTube tutorials available online. Additionally, keep an eye on the graduate school of the Radboud University as they often offer workshops on generating figures using Illustrator.

* [**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org/) (free software)
_How to get it?_ You can have directly download it from their website.
_How to start from scratch?_ Inkscape developers have provided extensive [tutorials](https://inkscape.org/learn/) for their users.

Remember that journals will have speicific guidelines for figures, you can find examples here:
* [Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/neuro/for-authors/preparing-your-submission)
* [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/page/authors/submission)

## Scientific Poster

A poster presentation at a conference offers a relaxed environment to present your work and receive valuable feedback early on (you can present early results, unfinished things, pilot data and even just the design itself, depending on the conference). Typically, you will be allocated a specific time and location to set up your poster. Try to arrive early so you have enough time to set up your poster (and bring a friend to give you a hand!). Conference organizers usually provide you with tacks/tape/whatever else needed to put the poster up, so you only need to supply the poster and yourself. You may be expected to stay at your poster for around an hour (double-check this with the conference program), so to engage with interested attendees. People will be walking around and looking at all the postersm and it can get quite crowded. Be prepared to give a short explanation of your work, keeping it casual and brief. In some cases, people will indicate they want more information and will aks you questions which will give you the chance to get into more detail. 

**Tips**:
* Think of your poster presentation as a conversation - you are explaining your work to someone, and using the poster simply to support you story. Do NOT just read out what is written on the poster.
* Prepare an extra-brief explanation (<2 minutes). Poster sessions can be very croweded and sometimes people will just want a very short explanation so they have enough time to look at other work.
* A poster is NOT the same as a research paper. You should focus on extracting the **key essence and necessary details**. If you are not standing by your poster, people should get an idea of what your work is about, but it should not be something that other researchers read. Keep it brief and simple. The emphasis should be on the figures (see above on how to generate figures)

### Poster Templates
Commonly used software for creating posters includes Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, PowerPoint, or Inkscape. Choose the one you are most comfortable with. At the DCCN, the default options are typically the Donders [templates](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=2963). You can download the specific format that suits your needs from the intranet page above. Alternatively, if you have a poster template you have encountered before and want to use, you are more than welcome to do so. All Radboud logos are available for download on this [page](https://www.ru.nl/corporateidentity/basic-elements/logo/) to include them in your poster.

Here are some examples from lab members:

* Marisha Manahova - Familiarity and Expectation
* Marisha Manahova - Signal Truncation
* Patricia Romero Verdugo
