This section provides helpful information on conducting Behavioral Experiments as a member of the Predictive Brain Lab. It includes concise summaries of the procedures outlines in the [intranet website](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=beh-labs), along with helpful tips and tricks, and references to useful resources for behavioral techniques.

# Behavioural Labs

The Trigon building of the DCCN has 9 cubicles on the basement (-1) floor that can be employed to conduct behavioral experiments. These cubicles are equipped with:

- A desk with a computer, mouse and keyboard
- Two button boxes
- Audioboxes and a set of headphones

_If you require additional materials, you can check the [intranet page](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=beh-labs-equipment) to see the different resources the univeristy has to offer_

Additionally, the DCCN has 3 larger behavioral labs that can be employed for your experiments. These have different locations and special lay-outs to match with different experimental paradigms. You can find information for those laboratories [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=beh-labs-layout)

To check for availability of the behavioral lab facilities you can make use of the [Donders Intranet Calendars](https://portal.dccn.nl/calendars/lab) (_Note_ you will need your Donders account to see this). 
There are two different ways to make bookings: 
* Pilots of Floris de Lange - for piloting procedures
* Using your personal number - this is only obtained after the project as been presented in a PPM meeting (see [_Lab Basics_](./lab_basics.md) PPM section)


**[ALL OF THE INFORMATION BELOW IS THE INFORMATION FROM THE OLD WIKI]**



When the experiment is going on inside, the red light outside should be turned on. This way others know that the room is in use. Be as quiet as possible in the hallway when lights at one or more of the cubicles is turned on.

Outside of the cubicles there is space for the experimenter to wait, while the experiment is taking place.

For a checklist of a behavioral session see this template and adjust it to your personal preferences.
