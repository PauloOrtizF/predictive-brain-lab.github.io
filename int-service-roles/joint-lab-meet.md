title: Joint Lab Meetings

To stimulate discussions and interactions with other researchers, the PBL sometimes (e.g. annually) decides to hold a ‘joint meeting’ with another group. This can be done virtually, but it seems more fruitful if held in-person. This day can then be thought of as nice mixture of scientific and social activities to get to know each other. Thus, the best labs to consider for a joint event are the more ‘local’ ones – either within Nijmegen or in The Netherlands more broadly. Previously, the lab has gone to Amsterdam for a joint day with the group of Jan Theeuwes, and their group has also come to Nijmegen. We have also held a joint meeting event with the group of Marius Peelen. ![image](https://github.com/PauloOrtizF/predictive-brain-lab.github.io/assets/122372980/8eb12816-5909-40cc-a63f-979617218b83)
