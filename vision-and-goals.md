The goal of the Predictive Brain Lab is to examine how the brain acquires and uses predictions, both in perception and cognition. We strive to understand this process at the computational, algorithmic and implementational level. Therefore, we use a multidisciplinary approach, focusing on behavioral and neural mechanisms of prediction, and utilizing a combination of psychophysics, non-invasive human neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG/MEG), and computational and neural network modeling approaches. We investigate the form and function of prediction in a wide range of contexts, e.g. visual and auditory perception, language, curiosity and information seeking. A range of different institutions support the research being conducted at the lab, namely, the Radboud University, NWO, and the European Union (ERC). For more information regarding the research carried out at the lab please see the [website](https://www.predictivebrainlab.com/). or the labâ€™s wiki.
