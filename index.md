Welcome to the Predictive Brain Lab Wiki!

We are based at the [Donders Institue for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/en/donders-institute) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en) in Nijmegen, Netherlands. This is the lab's wiki, which provides information regarding the **technical skills** relevant to perform research as part of our group. 

This handbook is the result of the efforts of the PI [Floris de Lange](https://www.predictivebrainlab.com/people/floris-de-lange) and [current and previous members of the lab](https://www.predictivebrainlab.com/people). For information regarding our team, research, and publications you can see our [website](https://www.predictivebrainlab.com/). 

We hope you have a great time during your stay in the lab and that this respository results useful to you!



### The wiki is divided into the following sections:

  
  

## Lab Basics

If you are new to the lab, or have more general admin questions, this is the place to start. You can find a guide to the lab, guides for more general procedures and some useful links to Donders resources.

* * * 
## Standard Operating Procedures

Here you will find the lab's guidelines and pipelines for conducting and analysing behavioural, fMRI and M/EEG data, as well as some general guidelines for conducting research in the lab.

* * * 

## Technical Help

Here you will find some technical guides (e.g. how to use the cluster), as well as links to sample code and useful resources.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two

1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
