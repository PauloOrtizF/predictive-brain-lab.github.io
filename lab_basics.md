This section will provide you with information regarding common technical practices within the lab. If what you are looking for is a more general introduction to our research group, you might want to look at our lab handbook[INSERT LINK WHEN READY].

## Standard Operating Procedures

At present, the members of the Predictive Brain lab often use similar, but not really standardised ways of processing their data. This will gradually change in the future, as we are committed to using standard operating procedures. These are thought to serve three purposes. First, they provide new researchers with easy-to-follow and easy-to-expand templates they can apply to their own research. Second, a standardised format for analysing data offers us all the ability to swiftly and easily exchange data with us and other labs. Lastly, standardised approaches offer the ability to compare the effects of different experiments.

In what follows, the current general SOP are outlined. This section will gradually expand as more standardisation is feasibly achieved between group members.

### Experiment preparation
**After initial study design**
* Small pilot (lab-specific booking rules here)
* PPM (see below), note that it might take up to a few weeks before the project code is available
* More extensive pilot (if necessary)

**After finalizing design**
* Set up study on SONA (info [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=recruiting-paying-subjects))
* Set up specific time slots in SONA.
* Book MRI/MEG/cubicle slot (+ support if required)
* Open slot on SONA
* Add time slots to your personalized or shared Google Calendar (if you have one)
* Set up [Castor](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=castor)
* Print the necessary [Informed Consent Forms & Subject Information Packages](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=4519)
* Familiarize with the [data management procedure](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=datastorage-archiving-sharing)

**When starting testing**
* Take a look at the [concept checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSTiefJdUuVGoO00uoj6vZxGBkfi-IeamdLvl56VwdY/edit?usp=sharing) and alter according to your own interests
