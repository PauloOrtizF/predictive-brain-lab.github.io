This section covers common research practices within the lab. For a general introduction to our research group, you might want to look at our lab handbook[INSERT LINK WHEN READY].

## Standard Operating Procedures
The Predictive Brain Lab has adopted standarized procedures for designing experiments and processing data for several years now. The employment of **standard operating procedures (SOP)** has three main advantages over individualized pipelines:
1. They provide new lab members with easily understandable and expandable templates for their research
2. They facilitate the exchange of data amongst lab members and external parties by establishing a common structure.
3. Standarized approaches facilitates the comparison of effects between different experiments.

In the following section, we will outline the general SOP. Over time, as all members adhere to these guidelines, the procedures will become more specific. Typically, these guidelines will be concise and direct you to detailed information about the aspects discussed on the [Donders Intranet Resources](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=1). 

### Experiment preparation
**After initial study design**
* Small pilot (lab-specific booking rules [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=laboratories))
* PPM (see below), note that it might take up to a few weeks before the project code is available
* More extensive pilot (if necessary)

**After finalizing design**
* Set up study on SONA (info [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=recruiting-paying-subjects))
* Set up specific time slots in SONA.
* Book MRI/MEG/cubicle slot (+ support if required)
* Open slot on SONA
* Add time slots to your personalized or shared Google Calendar (if you have one)
* Set up [Castor](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=castor)
* Print the necessary [Informed Consent Forms & Subject Information Packages](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=4519)
* Familiarize with the [data management procedure](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=datastorage-archiving-sharing)

**When starting testing**
* Take a look at the [concept checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSTiefJdUuVGoO00uoj6vZxGBkfi-IeamdLvl56VwdY/edit?usp=sharing) and alter according to your own interests
