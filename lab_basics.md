This section covers common research practices within the lab. For a general introduction to our research group, you might want to look at our lab handbook[INSERT LINK WHEN READY].

## Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Experimental Designs
The Predictive Brain Lab has adopted standarized procedures for designing experiments and processing data for several years now. The employment of **standard operating procedures (SOP)** has three main advantages over individualized pipelines:
1. They provide new lab members with easily understandable and expandable templates for their research
2. They facilitate the exchange of data amongst lab members and external parties by establishing a common structure.
3. Standarized approaches facilitates the comparison of effects between different experiments.

In the following section, we will outline the general SOP. Over time, as all members adhere to these guidelines, the procedures will become more specific. Typically, these guidelines will be concise and direct you to detailed information about the aspects discussed on the [Donders Intranet Resources](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=1). 

### Experiment preparation
**Following initial study design**
* Presentation on the General Lab Meeting to get feedback on initial study design
* Test scripts, equipment, tasks, and procedures with a small pilot (see [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=5960) for rules about pilot designs at DCCN and [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=laboratories) on how to book a lab)
* Present your work and proposal to Donders in a [PPM](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=research-ppm) (see below)
* Test again using a more extensive pilot (if necessary)

**After finalizing design**
* Set up your study on SONA, the university's recruitment platform (info [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=recruiting-paying-subjects))
* Set up specific time slots in SONA.
* Book MRI/MEG/behavioral cubicle slot (+ [support from research assistant](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=5533) if required)
* Open slot on SONA
* Add time slots to your personalized or shared Google Calendar (if you have one)
* Set up [Castor](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=castor), an online platform to keep track of all relevant documents of participants in your study
* Print the necessary [Informed Consent Forms](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6769) & [Subject Information Packages](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6770)(Check that you are **always** using the last version of these forms)
* Familiarize yourself with the [data management procedure](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=datastorage-archiving-sharing)

**When starting testing**
* Take a look at the [concept checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSTiefJdUuVGoO00uoj6vZxGBkfi-IeamdLvl56VwdY/edit?usp=sharing) and alter according to your own interests. It is always a good idea to make sure everything is as standarized as possible.
