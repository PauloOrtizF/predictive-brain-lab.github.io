This section covers common research practices within the lab. For a general introduction to our research group, you might want to look at our lab handbook[INSERT LINK WHEN READY].

## Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Experimental Designs
The Predictive Brain Lab has adopted standarized procedures for designing experiments and processing data for several years now. The employment of **standard operating procedures (SOP)** has three main advantages over individualized pipelines:
1. They provide new lab members with easily understandable and expandable templates for their research
2. They facilitate the exchange of data amongst lab members and external parties by establishing a common structure.
3. Standarized approaches facilitates the comparison of effects between different experiments.

In the following section, we will outline the general SOP. Over time, as all members adhere to these guidelines, the procedures will become more specific. Typically, these guidelines will be concise and direct you to detailed information about the aspects discussed on the [Donders Intranet Resources](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=1). 

### Experiment preparation
**Following initial study design**
* Presentation on the General Lab Meeting to get feedback on initial study design
* Test scripts, equipment, tasks, and procedures with a small pilot (see [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=5960) for rules about pilot designs at DCCN and [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=laboratories) on how to book a lab)
* Present your work and proposal to Donders in a [PPM](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=research-ppm) (see below)
* Test again using a more extensive pilot (if necessary)

**After finalizing design**
* Set up your study on SONA, the university's recruitment platform (info [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=recruiting-paying-subjects))
* Set up specific time slots in SONA.
* Book MRI/MEG/behavioral cubicle slot (+ [support from research assistant](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=5533) if required)
* Open slot on SONA
* Add time slots to your personalized or shared Google Calendar (if you have one)
* Set up [Castor](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=castor), an online platform to keep track of all relevant documents of participants in your study
* Print the necessary [Informed Consent Forms](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6769) & [Subject Information Packages](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6770) (Check that you are **always** using the last version of these forms)
* Familiarize yourself with the [data management procedure](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=datastorage-archiving-sharing)

**When starting testing**
* Take a look at the [concept checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSTiefJdUuVGoO00uoj6vZxGBkfi-IeamdLvl56VwdY/edit?usp=sharing) and alter according to your own interests. It is always a good idea to make sure everything is as standarized as possible.

## Giving a Project Proposal Meeting (PPM)
All studies conducted at the DDCN of the Donders Institute must undergo the PPM procedure. This involves of a presentation where your study is evaluated on terms of quality, feasibility, methods, analysis, ethics and alignment with the DCCN's research objectives. Additionally,  reserchers are required to submit an online form. Upon completions of the previous steps, you will receive a project number which gives you access to the facilities of the insitute. 

A detailed description of all the steps you must follow for the PPM meeting can be found [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=research-ppm)

### Presentation
Two ways to become familiar with PPM:
1. Attend the weekly Thursday PPMs in the Red Room. Information on this week's presentation can be found [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=1) or in the DCCN mailing list.
2. Visit the [Predictive Brain Lab page](https://portal.dccn.nl/explore/group/predatt) on the Project Database to access slides from previous presentations by lab members. These slides can be downloaded in a PDF format under Attachments. Alternatively, you can search for a specific lab member in case you want to see how they presented specific methods of theoretical backgrounds. 

Feeling intimidated about giving a PPM? No need to worry! The researchers in the audience are here to support you and help you improve your project, not to crticize your work! Donderians are genuinely interested on the research happening at the institute!

**Presentation Tips:**
* Use the General Lab Meeting to practice your presentation! These time slots are perfect to receive some valuab;e feedback from the group on your design, analyses, presentation structure, and (if you want) on your presentation skills! Moreover, the questions and comments you get from the group might also be informative of those that you can expect from the audience during the actual PPM.
* Schedule your practice session well in advance (at least a week before your real PPM), so you will have enough time to incorporate the feedback. You can find the organizer of the Group Meetins [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-p_r4GLCh4wok5BapZ6wtmsAPfmVzbRjLF9QH-F-mtI/edit?usp=sharing)
* Take notes during your (practice) PPM or ask a group member to do so for you. This ensures you will caputre all the important and interest comments and suggestions people bring up during your presentation!
