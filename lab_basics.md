# Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
The Predictive Brain Lab has adopted standarized procedures for designing experiments and processing data for several years now. The employment of **standard operating procedures (SOP)** has three main advantages over individualized pipelines:
1. They provide new lab members with easily understandable and expandable templates for their research
2. They facilitate the exchange of data amongst lab members and external parties by establishing a common structure.
3. Standarized approaches facilitates the comparison of effects between different experiments.

In the following section, we will outline the general SOP. Over time, as all members adhere to these guidelines, the procedures will become more specific. Typically, these guidelines will be concise and direct you to detailed information about the aspects discussed on the [Donders Intranet Resources](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=1). 

## Preparing Experimental Designs
**Following initial study design**
* Presentation on the General Lab Meeting to get feedback on initial study design
* Test scripts, equipment, tasks, and procedures with a small pilot (see [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=5960) for rules about pilot designs at DCCN and [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=laboratories) on how to book a lab)
* Present your work and proposal to Donders in a [PPM](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=research-ppm) (see below)
* Test again using a more extensive pilot (if necessary)

**After finalizing design**
* Set up your study on SONA, the university's recruitment platform (info [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=recruiting-paying-subjects))
* Set up specific time slots in SONA.
* Book MRI/MEG/behavioral cubicle slot (+ [support from research assistant](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=5533) if required)
* Open slot on SONA
* Add time slots to your personalized or shared Google Calendar (if you have one)
* Set up [Castor](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=castor), an online platform to keep track of all relevant documents of participants in your study
* Print the necessary [Informed Consent Forms](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6769) & [Subject Information Packages](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6770) (Check that you are **always** using the last version of these forms)
* Familiarize yourself with the [data management procedure](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=datastorage-archiving-sharing)

**When starting testing**
* Take a look at the [concept checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSTiefJdUuVGoO00uoj6vZxGBkfi-IeamdLvl56VwdY/edit?usp=sharing) and alter according to your own interests. It is always a good idea to make sure everything is as standarized as possible.

## Giving a Project Proposal Meeting (PPM)
All studies conducted at the DDCN of the Donders Institute must undergo the PPM procedure. This involves of a presentation where your study is evaluated on terms of quality, feasibility, methods, analysis, ethics and alignment with the DCCN's research objectives. Additionally,  reserchers are required to submit an online form. Upon completions of the previous steps, you will receive a project number which gives you access to the facilities of the insitute. 

A detailed description of all the steps you must follow for the PPM meeting can be found [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=research-ppm)

### Presentation
Two ways to become familiar with PPM:
1. Attend the weekly Thursday PPMs in the Red Room. Information on this week's presentation can be found [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=1) or in the DCCN mailing list.
2. Visit the [Predictive Brain Lab page](https://portal.dccn.nl/explore/group/predatt) on the Project Database to access slides from previous presentations by lab members. These slides can be downloaded in a PDF format under Attachments. Alternatively, you can search for a specific lab member in case you want to see how they presented specific methods of theoretical backgrounds. 

Feeling intimidated about giving a PPM? No need to worry! The researchers in the audience are here to support you and help you improve your project, not to crticize your work! Donderians are genuinely interested on the research happening at the institute!

**Presentation Tips:**
* Use the General Lab Meeting to practice your presentation! These time slots are perfect to receive some valuab;e feedback from the group on your design, analyses, presentation structure, and (if you want) on your presentation skills! Moreover, the questions and comments you get from the group might also be informative of those that you can expect from the audience during the actual PPM.
* Schedule your practice session well in advance (at least a week before your real PPM), so you will have enough time to incorporate the feedback. You can find the organizer of the Group Meetins [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-p_r4GLCh4wok5BapZ6wtmsAPfmVzbRjLF9QH-F-mtI/edit?usp=sharing)
* Take notes during your (practice) PPM or ask a group member to do so for you. This ensures you will caputre all the important and interest comments and suggestions people bring up during your presentation!

### Calculating Sample Size
* Sample size should be established before data collection begins. Whenever possible, conduct a power calculation to determine sample size. We recommend using [G*Power](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower.html) software for it. It contains useful tutorials and videos on how to get an informed sample size for your study.
* If a power calculation for your study is too complicated, you can follow this default rule: Aim for studies with at least 80% power to detect effect sizes of at least moderate magnitude (Cohen's d > 0.5).
  * For within-subject designs, recruit N = 34 subjects with good data quality.
  * For between-subjects designs, recruit N = 64 subjects per group.

### Project Proposal Sheet

Part of doing a PPM entails filling in the [Project Proposal Sheet](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=research-ppm) online. 
**Tips**
* Most projects in the lab fall under the blanket of approval CMO2014/288. This means you may not need to request ethical approval for your individual project! See [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6771) if that is the case for you.
* For behavioral projects the standard storage quota is usually enough. For neuroimaging projects, you will calculate your own storage quota. **Keep in mind** that is you need to store in-between analyses steps, you may need storage space for that.
* To make the process as smooth as possible, get all the required signatures of your Project Proposal Sheet before the PPM presentation. Thus, you can start your experiment right away.


## Preregistration
For the Predictive Lab's stance on Open Science practices and preregistration please refer to our handbook [INSERT LINK WHEN READY]
In the lab we use two different platforms to preregister our studies:
1. https://aspredicted.org/
2. https://osf.io/
with **As Predicted** following a specific structure and **OSF** providing more freedom to your structure. 

The current page provides you with guidance on the information you might want to include in your pre-registration document: 

1. The title of your project.
2. Whether any data have been collected for the study already.
3. The research questions and the hypotheses.
- What are the questions you want to answer with the current study?
- What are your hypotheses?
4. The variables and conditions in your study
- What is the dependent variable?
- What are the independent variables?
- What conditions do you have?
- Is the design event-related or blockwise (for fMRI studies)
5. Primary analyses
- What are the most important analyses you are going to perform?
- How are you going to perform these analyses?
- On which effects are you focusing to answer your main questions?
- How are you going to define your ROIs (for fMRI studies)?
6. Secondary analyses
- What other analyses are you going to perform?
7. Sample size
- How many participants will you test?
- How do you justify this sample size? (see also your PPM)
8. Quality check of your data
- How do you determine whether the data quality is good?
- When will you exclude a participant?
- i.e. if they missed more than â€¦% of all trials.
- i.e. if they showed excessive motion during scanning.
9. Other
- Are there any other aspects of the study you would like to preregister?

# Communicating Your Research Findings
The ability to clearly communicate your findings with other researchers and the general public is one of the most important skills to have as a scientist. For instance, think about the emphasis we give to paper figures during journal club discussions. They not only emphasize key points in a paper but also enable other researchers to consider alternative conclusions from the same data.

The present section will provide  guidelines or resources you can use to generate figures, posters, give lectures or other forms of scientific communication. 

## Creating Figures
Eye-catching figures and fonts do not onlu facilitate communication but imrpove the experience of listening to a presentation or reading a paper! Mastering the skill of creating visually appealing figures directly from your code editor (Python, MatLab, R) not only saves you time but also promotes reproducibility in your analyses!

### Generating Figures
Various resources are available for learning how to create figures from your data. Below, we'll highlight those tailored to the three main programs used by lab members: **Python, R, and Matlab**. (note: _if you are new to programming, check the [Technical Help](/.technical_help.md) section, we highlight resources to learn how to code_)

Nonetheless, there are notions that are important to keep in mind regardless of the software used for your analyses. [Here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833) is a concise paper with ten important considerations to keep in mind when generating figures.

**MatLab Resources**





### ALL OF THE BELOW IS ANNE URAI's LAB INFO
Iâ€™m a sucker for nice-looking figures (and fonts).
Learn how to make your figures look good straight out of Python/Matlab/Julia/R, and minimize the time spent changing things in Illustrator/InkScape. This will not only save a lot of time in the long run, it also makes your analyses more reproducible.

Here are slides of a figure workshop we did in lab meeting on 26 February 2024. Watch back the recording when youâ€™re starting to make your own figures!
