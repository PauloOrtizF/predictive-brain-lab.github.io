# Updating the Wiki

This page provides a _step-by-step_ on how to contribute to this wiki repository. 
As this is a resource with the lab members in mind, we highly encourage your contribution to it. We selected GitHub as the hosting website given the feasibility to employ this resource by many users simulatenously. 

If you have any resources/tools/knowledge you think others might find useful. Please add them to the current website. 

### Contributing to This Wiki

If you have never used GitHub before, please go to the [Technical Help](./technical_help) page of the wiki and check our resources on how to use GitHub. **You do not need to be an expert on GitHub to be able to edit this website**. It should take max. _30 minutes_ of your time to understand how to use the basic functions (_e.g.,_ creating an account, forking a repository, pull request, etc) and be able to edit this page. 

#### Step-by-Step 

1. Go to the repository where the wiki is hosted ([here](INSERT LINK WHEN READY))
2. Fork (_ie.,_ personal new repository that share the code with original repository) the repository -- _forks are used to propose changes to someone else's code._
3. Clone the fork to your own personal GitHub account (_note_ you must have a GitHub account to edit this wiki)
4. Once you succesfully forked the repository, browse through the _Files_ tab on the left side of the website screen displaying the different files linked to that repository. Their structure should be self explanatory as clear labels and folders have been used. These files are the different components of the wiki. Those ending with `.md` are Markdown files and contain the content displayed in the wiki. These are the ones that you will be editing (if you do not know how to use Markdown, see our [how_to_markdown](./how_to_markdown.md) file containing different function examples or find more info. online) 
5. Find the `.md` file you want to edit or create a new one using the following header:
```
--- 
layout: default
title: where to get tasty lunch around the DCCN?
rank: 1 
---
```
_Note:_ only add the rank section if you want the page to be displayed as one of the options on the wiki's index.


6. Add the information you want and then click on the _commit changes_ green button on the top right (this saves the changes you did on your local fork of the repository)
7. Once you have succesfully applied all the changes you saw fitting, create a **Pull Request** (_ie.,_ a request to add the changes you incorporated to the original wiki repository). Go to the Pull Requests / New / Compare across forks and select your fork. Clearly explain in the box they provide all the things you modified and why you modified them. The person responsible for the wiki will incorporate these edits to the main page.

**That is it! You've done it! You see how easy it was?**


### How do I know if my information if worth incorporating to the wiki?

Easy! If you are in doubt, you can always drop a message in the **MatterMost** channel dedicated to the wiki and ask other lab members whether this is information they would like to see in the wiki!

Otherwise, make the request and if the person responsible for the wiki does not think this information is suitable for the wiki, they will get in touch with you!
